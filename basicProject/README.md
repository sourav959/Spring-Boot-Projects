## Basic Spring Boot Project
___
```
This Spring Boot project is a foundational example featuring one entity and one API endpoint:
    1. Entity: User (id, Name)
    2. API: "/users" - Retrieves data for all registered users
    
Within this project, distinct layers serve specific functions such as controller, entity, service, and repository, all interconnected with an embedded H2 database.

Designed as a comprehensive Spring Boot project, this setup is ideal for beginners looking to delve into the framework's structure and functionality.
